# Backend Code Challenge

Welcome to our backend app for managing packages, shows, and networks. In this app, you can perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on each of these entities.

## Using the app
<br/>

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js and npm installed on your machine
2. A PostgreSQL server set up and running on your machine
<br/>

### Instructions
1. Set up the app
2. Clone the repository
3. Run npm install in the root directory to install the required dependencies
4. Create a .env file in the root directory and set the following environment variables:
- DB_USER: the username to connect to the PostgreSQL server
- DB_PASSWORD: the password for the user specified in DB_USER
- DB_HOST: the hostname for the PostgreSQL server
- DB_PORT: the port number for the PostgreSQL server
- DB_DATABASE: the name of the database to connect to
5. Run the SQL scripts in the seederFunctions directory to set up the required tables and sample data
6. Run npm start to start the app

## Database Structure
<br/>

### Description
Our database includes three main entities: packages, shows, and networks. A package can have many networks, and a network can have many shows. This relationship is represented in the database by the package_network and show_network tables, which contain foreign keys to the package and network tables respectively.
